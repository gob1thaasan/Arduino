# Arduino
Simple weekend Arduino UNO project. Each project folder contains a breadboard picture, code and a short video. Below is the list:
---
1.  TwoButton: adding first project which involves two buttons to control a LED. This project involves two inputs from the buttons to correspond to two outputs, one builtin LED connected to D13 and another LED connected to D9 directly. The demo video available at [Youtube](https://youtu.be/2UX8akIyRBY)

2.  Photoresister: or also known as Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR) is a resistor which varies the resistance based on the amount of light. This project involves a circuit that lights an LED when it is sufficiently dark in a room. I demonstrate the circuit by covering the photoresistor to simulate darkness, available at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIxY1L2sM7U)
